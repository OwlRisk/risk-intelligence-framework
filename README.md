# 🦉 OwlRisk – Risk Intelligence Framework

**OwlRisk** is an **AI-driven risk intelligence system** that helps organizations detect, verify, and act on critical risks earlier than anyone else.  
This repository hosts the **strategic framework** and **reference documents** that guide our product and ecosystem development.

## 🎯 Strategic Positioning
OwlRisk is **not just another monitoring tool**.  
It is the **trusted intelligence infrastructure** that sits between raw data and critical business decisions.

Our core values:
- **Earlier** → Detect risks faster than alternatives  
- **Accurate** → Reduced noise & false positives  
- **Verifiable** → Evidence chains & audit trails  
- **Actionable** → Clear impact pathways & next steps  

---

## 🚀 Market Entry (Beachhead)
Our initial focus is **Web3 Risk Intelligence**:
- **Regulatory Updates** → SEC, MAS, SFC, EU announcements & enforcement  
- **Exchange Events** → Listings, delistings, suspensions, maintenance  
- **Contract Security & On-chain Anomalies** → ETH/SOL/BSC/TON vulnerabilities & unusual activities  

Why Web3?  
- Minute-level time sensitivity  
- High financial exposure  
- Strong willingness to pay  
- Clear causal relationships

## 🏗 Four Strategic Pillars
1. **EVSI** (Earliest Verifiable Source Index) → Snapshots + timestamps + audit evidence  
2. **IPM** (Impact Pathway Model) → Event → Entity Graph → Risk exposure  
3. **SCG + RDS** (Source Credibility Graph + Risk Delta Scoring) → Reduce noise, increase actionability  
4. **LPD** (Latency-per-Dollar Optimization) → Faster + cheaper alerts  

---

## 📦 Product & UX
- **Form**: Website + Browser Extension  
- **Risk Packs**: One-click scenarios (exchange events, security incidents, governance, releases)  
- **Trust-building**: Evidence-first alerts, shadow comparison, public SLOs, feedback loop  
- **Calm UX**: Guardian mode, quiet hours, peace receipts  

---

## ⚙️ Technology & Cost Architecture
- **Data Collection**: RSS/API → HTTP → Headful render (Playwright)  
- **Diff & Models**: Lightweight diff + small models, minimal LLM usage  
- **Queues & Sharing**: Same source scraped once, shared across users  
- **Observability**: Latency, false positive rate, AI cost per effective alert  

🏆 **Competitive Advantage**:  
- Data network effects  
- Intelligence flywheel  
- Cost efficiency (10x lower unit cost)  

---

## 🌍 Global Strategy
- **Phase 1**: EN markets (US/EU/SG/HK/AE)  
- **Phase 2**: Localized markets (KR/JP/TR/BR/ID)  
- **Engineering**: i18n, multi-region queues, compliance-first  

---

## 💼 Commercialization
- **Pro Tier** → Individual professionals  
- **Team Tier** → Collaboration & audit trails  
- **Enterprise Tier** → SSO, RBAC, compliance, dedicated infra  

📊 **North Star Metric**: Effective Risk Alerts per User per Week
