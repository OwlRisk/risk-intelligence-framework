            Four Strategic Pillars
        </h2>

        <div class="pillar">
            <h4>EVSI <span class="pillar-code">(Earliest Verifiable Source Index)</span></h4>
            <p>Every event includes <strong>snapshots + timestamps + evidence chains</strong> to auditably prove "we detected it first"</p>
            <div class="rationale">
                Transforms our speed advantage from marketing claim to verifiable metric. Creates competitive moat through data transparency—competitors can't easily replicate without similar evidence infrastructure.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="pillar">
            <h4>IPM <span class="pillar-code">(Impact Pathway Model)</span></h4>
            <p>Event → Entity Graph (assets/upstream/regulatory) → Your specific risk exposure (impact score/direction)</p>
            <div class="rationale">
                Solves the "So What?" problem. Users don't want to know that something happened—they want to know how it affects their portfolio, compliance posture, or operational risk. This bridges the gap between information and action.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="pillar">
            <h4>SCG + RDS <span class="pillar-code">(Source Credibility Graph + Risk Delta Scoring)</span></h4>
            <p>Source reputation mapping (reduce false positives) + Risk increment scoring (increase actionability)</p>
            <div class="rationale">
                SCG learns from user feedback to weight sources based on historical accuracy and relevance. RDS focuses attention on meaningful changes rather than noise. Together, they create a self-improving signal-to-noise ratio.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="pillar">
            <h4>LPD <span class="pillar-code">(Latency-per-Dollar Optimization)</span></h4>
            <p>Shared trigger caching, two-tier decision making, priority queues for faster and cheaper operations</p>
            <div class="rationale">
                Speed advantage must be economically sustainable. Shared infrastructure reduces marginal costs while maintaining performance. Two-tier processing (fast screening + careful analysis) optimizes the speed/accuracy tradeoff for different alert priorities.

            Product & User Experience
        </h2>
        
        <h3>Product Form</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="key-point">Website + Browser Extension:</span> Extension handles local collection from logged-in sites, only uploads diffs and metadata</li>
            <li><span class="key-point">Dual Mode:</span> Default Express (result-oriented); Collapsible Pro (deep customization)</li>
            <li><span class="key-point">Risk Packs:</span> One-click scenario templates
                <ul>
                    <li>Exchange listing/delisting/maintenance</li>
                    <li>Security incidents (vulnerabilities/hacks/key leaks/bridge anomalies)</li>

                    <li>Version releases & security fixes</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="rationale">
            Browser extension solves the "login wall" problem that kills most scraping solutions—users provide their authenticated access, we only handle the intelligent processing. Risk Packs reduce time-to-value from weeks to minutes, addressing the #1 churn reason: "too complex to set up."
        </div>

        <h3>Trust-Building Quartet</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="key-point">Evidence First:</span> Every alert comes with source links, diff snippets, discovery time, lead minutes, confidence score; one-click "verify at source"</li>
            <li><span class="key-point">Shadow Comparison:</span> New users see "official source timeline vs our hits" for first 7-14 days</li>
            <li><span class="key-point">Public SLO Status Page:</span> Real-time display of P50/P95 latency, effectiveness rate, noise rate + incident post-mortems</li>
            <li><span class="key-point">Feedback Loop:</span> One-click labeling of "false positive/reason", system auto-converges thresholds and blacklist terms</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="rationale">
            Trust is the biggest barrier in risk intelligence—one missed critical event destroys credibility forever. Shadow comparison provides immediate proof of value, while public SLOs demonstrate confidence in our performance. Evidence-first design turns every alert into a defensible audit trail.
        </div>

        <h3>Anti-Anxiety (Calm UX)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Guardian mode (Critical only) + quiet hours + All-clear peace receipts + hourly/daily summaries</li>
            <li>Configurable daily alert limits (Critical unlimited); non-stimulating colors, refresh cooldown</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="rationale">
            Risk professionals suffer from chronic alert fatigue and burnout. By designing for calm rather than attention-grabbing, we increase long-term retention and decision quality. All-clear receipts specifically address the "what if I missed something" anxiety that drives compulsive checking behavior.

            Technology & Cost Architecture
        </h2>
        <p><em>Explainable, scalable, cost-controllable</em></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><span class="key-point">Scraping Priority:</span> API/RSS > HTTP (with ETag/Last-Modified conditional requests) > Headful rendering (Playwright when necessary)</li>
            <li><span class="key-point">Diff & Models:</span> Only apply similarity pre-filtering to diff snippets → small model classification → minimal large model use (cost reduction)</li>
            <li><span class="key-point">Queues & Source Sharing:</span> Adaptive frequency control based on source change rate and user SLA; same URL scraped once, shared across users</li>
            <li><span class="key-point">Observability:</span> 304 hit rate, change rate, latency, AI cost per effective alert, false positive complaint rate</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="rationale">
            This architecture prioritizes marginal cost reduction over infrastructure complexity. API/RSS sources cost $0.001/check vs $0.1/headful render. Diff-only processing reduces LLM token usage by 95%. Shared collection with per-user intelligence creates natural economies of scale—more users = lower per-user costs.

            Anti-Scraping Strategy
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="key-point">Network/CDN Layer:</span> IP/ASN rate limiting, reputation scoring, seamless challenges; search engine whitelist</li>
            <li><span class="key-point">Application Layer:</span> HMAC signed parameters, cursor pagination, max depth/response body limits, repeat scraping 304</li>
            <li><span class="key-point">Frontend Layer:</span> Light DOM polymorphism, honeypots/watermarks (forensics, no SEO/accessibility impact)</li>
            <li><span class="key-point">Identity & Audit:</span> Account/organization quotas, behavior scoring, evidence chain</li>
            <li><span class="key-point">Front Door:</span> Official API for partners (signing, quotas, complexity limits, audit)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="rationale">
            Anti-scraping isn't about blocking legitimate use—it's about sustainable resource allocation. Rate limiting prevents infrastructure overload, while honeypots identify bad actors. The "front door" API creates a revenue stream from heavy users while reducing adversarial scraping pressure.

            Globalization Strategy
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="key-point">Phase 1:</span> EN markets & crypto-friendly hubs (US/EU/SG/HK/AE), Stripe direct payment, English priority</li>
            <li><span class="key-point">Phase 2:</span> Strong localization markets KR/JP/TR/BR/ID (language + local data sources + payment)</li>
            <li><span class="key-point">Engineering:</span> i18n/i10n, timezone/number/currency, multi-region queues & proxies, regional circuit breakers & rate limiting</li>
            <li><span class="key-point">Legal & Privacy:</span> Data minimization (store only diffs + metadata), 30-day logs, optional residency, clear "non-investment advisory" disclaimers</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="rationale">
            English-first markets have established crypto ecosystems and higher willingness to pay for B2B tools. Phase 2 markets require local payment methods and regulatory compliance but offer 5x larger TAM. By proving unit economics in Phase 1, we can fund the higher-touch localization for Phase 2.

            Commercialization & Packaging

        <h3>Tiered Package Strategy</h3>
        <p>Three-tier packages (value-oriented, not technical feature stacking):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="key-point">Pro Tier:</span> Individual professionals and small teams - focus on personal productivity gains</li>
            <li><span class="key-point">Team Tier:</span> Growing organizations with collaboration needs - shared workflows and audit trails</li>
            <li><span class="key-point">Enterprise Tier:</span> Large organizations requiring SSO/RBAC/audit export/data residency/dedicated proxy pools/custom sources/SLA</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="rationale">
            Tiering by organizational complexity, not usage volume, aligns pricing with value delivered. Pro users pay for personal time savings, Team users pay for coordination benefits, Enterprise pays for compliance and integration. This creates natural upgrade paths as organizations grow.
        </div>

        <p><span class="key-point">Sales Materials:</span> Cases presented in "lead minutes → action → avoided losses" structure; technical depth relegated to security whitepapers and procurement attachments.</p>
        
        <div class="rationale">
            Decision makers care about ROI, not technical sophistication. A single case study of "our alert 15 minutes before official announcement prevented $2M trading loss" is worth more than any feature list. Technical details become relevant only after value is established.

                "Effective alerts per week" captures both frequency and quality—it can only improve by sending more relevant signals or reducing noise.
